I plan to graduate from university in 2025. I majored in computer engineering and learned compiler constructs, computer networks, operating systems, and big data analysis.

After graduation, I plan to study and obtain an information processing engineer certification, and am studying technologies related to the SWIFT language to become an iOS developer.
